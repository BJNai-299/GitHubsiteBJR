## Introduction
My research this summer is an extension of the Digital Humanities project called the Colored Conventions Project. Digital Humanities is a relatively new field that began roughly 60 or so years ago. The definition of Digital Humanities is still debated by some scholars but it is mainly described as the study of digital technologies and how they intersect with different humanity studies. Digital Humanities intersects with the Black studies and Black activism, that began in the early 2000s.

The Colored Conventions project is one of the first Digital Humanities projects to study this area. The Colored Conventions project stems from the Colored Conventions Movement. The Colored Conventions movement was a movement that began in 1830 in Philadelphia when an African American man named Richard Allen put out a call in the local Black newspapers for African Americans to meet at his church Mother Bethel to discuss how to help each other and discuss ways to move towards the abolishment of slavery. That was the first of many conventions held all over the nation. Many famous African American figures attended several of these conventions such as Frederick Douglass and Henry Highland Garnet. The Colored Conventions Project collects and digitizes the documents of these different conventions into different exhibits and also seeks to highlight the role of African American women in this movement to share with public and other teachers for them to share with their students and have them research these conventions and be credited for their research. My research this summer focuses on the Conventions of postbellum in southern America specifically Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama as far as how well they were documented, where, and what the conventions encompassed.
